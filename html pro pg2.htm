Martial arts are the techniques of self defence and it was originated in South India. It was created by a 
Buddhist monk,"BODHIDHARMA". Due to some reasons he went China and there he taught Chinese people
about it.Karate is a martial art developed on the Ryukyu islands (at present, Okinawa, Japan). It developed
under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fijian White Crane.Karate is now a predominantly
striking art using punches, kicks, knee and elbow strikes and open hand strikes such as knife-hand, spear-hand
and palm-heel strikes. Historically and in some modern styles, grappling, throws, joint-lock, restrains and vital point
strikes are also taught. A Karate practitioner is called "Karateka".
Karate developed in the Ryukyu kingdom. It was brought to the Japanese mainland in the early 20 <sup> th</sup>
century during the time of cultural exchange between Chinese and Japanese people. 
It was systematically taught there after the Taisho era.    
In 1922, Japanese ministry of education invited Gichin Funakoshi to give a Karate demonstration.
In 1924, Keio university established the 1 <sup>st</sup> university Karate club in mainland Japan and by 1932, major 
Japanese universities had Karate clubs.
After World War ll, Okinawa became an important United States millitary site and karate becme popular among 
servicemen stationed there. The martial arts movies of the 1960s and 1970s served greatly to increase the popularity 
of martial atrs around the world.
Karate schools began appearing across the world, catering to those with casual interest as well as to those seeking 
a deeper study of the art.
